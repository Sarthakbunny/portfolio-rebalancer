# 📊 Portfolio Rebalancer (AI-powered with Gemini)

This project is a simple AI tool that helps you **analyze and rebalance your stock portfolio** using **Google’s Gemini API**.

It:

1. Parses your **current portfolio CSV**.
2. Asks Gemini (acting as a chief financial planner) to:

   * Suggest **Buy / Sell / Hold** decisions for your current stocks.
   * Recommend **outside portfolio stocks** for diversification & long-term growth.
3. Outputs a **final CSV** with two sections:

   * **Current Portfolio Modifications**
   * **Outside Portfolio Buyable Stocks**

---

## 🚀 Features

* Simple **3-function workflow**:

  * `parse_csv(path)` → Reads portfolio CSV into a DataFrame.
  * `rebalance_portfolio(df, goal, invest_time, api_key)` → Uses Gemini for recommendations.
  * `merge_results(mods, buys, output_path)` → Combines both arrays into one CSV.
* Uses **Gemini-1.5-Pro** model for financial reasoning.
* Tested locally (no Colab needed).
* Easy to extend and integrate.
